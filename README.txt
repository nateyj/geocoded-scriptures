Project 5 User Experience Suggestions:

1. There needs to be a grid to mark the middle of the screen where the pin suggestion will be.
2. There needs to be a different icon besides a camera to indicate that the user is suggesting a location. The “snapshot” idea makes sense when I discuss it with the app creator, but it’s not intuitive as user. I would have a lighter colored pin icon at the top and in the middle of the screen to indicate where I’m suggesting a location to be for that word I select.
3. I would automatically go to “See Map” when the user selects a word then clicks “suggest geocoding”. I don’t like the extra step. I would want to see the “suggest geocoding” page with the latitude and longitude after I placed my suggested pin, but not before.
4. The user definitely needs a tutorial to understand this part of the app. It wouldn’t be easy to understand otherwise.
